Flight options:

Easiest and fastes way is to fly to Svolvær airport (SVJ) you can catch a direct flight from Oslo (OSL) to Svolvær or fly to Bodø (BOO) and then to Svolvær - these flights are usually the most expensive, and are operated by [www.wideroe.no](http://www.wideroe.no/)

Second best option is flying to Leknes (LKN), 1 hour away from us by bus or car.

You can reach Leknes directly from Oslo or via Bodø with [www.wideroe.no](http://www.wideroe.no/)

Third alternative (THIS IS USUALLY THE CHEAPEST OPTION) is a flight to Evenes (EVE). Evenes is reachable from Oslo, Stockholm (ARN) and many other desinations, and has many airlines porting, so usually many options and the cheapest options. From Evenes you can catch a 3 hour bus to Lofoten and Svolvær.

Fourth alternativ is a flight to Tromsø (TOS) but this is a complicated commute to Lofoten, and takes about 6-7 hours by bus, including changing busses a few times.

Schedule from Tromsø to Lofoten can be checked here: [https://177nordland.no/](https://177nordland.no/ "https://177nordland.no/")

Bus connections: - there are 2 options going to and from Evenes

1: The airport bus (this is the best option)

The airport bus corresponds with most flights into Evenes, and takes you directly to Svolvær, and only a 5 minute walk from the bus station to our office. The schedule can be checked here: [www.flybussen.no](http://www.flybussen.no/)

2\. The local bus also takes you to and from the airport, but takes a little longer. You can check the schedule here: www.177nordland.no
