The Lofoten island are the amazing archipelago in the north of Norway, in the **Arctic Circle**, that offers breathtaking scenery with mountain peaks over beautiful view, Arctic fjords, small fishing villages and beautiful clean water beaches.

**This is a unique trip: Lofoten landscapes and colours are like nowhere else in the world.**

### How to arrive there 

All the option are intended from Oslo\`;

1. **Fly to Svolvær (expensive)** 

   Svolvær is the capital of Lofoten and the location of most of the companies that rent campervan. Flying directly into Svolvær Airport is the most convenient and fastest option, but also the most expensive. Direct flights are only from Oslo or Bodø.


2. **Fly to Leknes (expensive)** 

   Leknes is in heart of the **_Lofoten_** Islands

   You can here directly from Oslo or from Bodø 
3. **Fly to Evenes (cheapest option)**

   Evenes is reachable from Oslo and many other destinations, and has many low-cost airlines (norwegian airlines) flying here, so there are many more and much cheaper options.   
   From Evenes you can then take a 3-hour bus to Lofoten and their capital Svolvær (at a cost of 40EUR one way).   
   The timetables are not the best, but there is an airport bus that matches most flights, you can check the timetables on google maps and buy the ticket directly on board with a credit card. 
4. **Take a ferry from Bodo**

   You can take the ferry that sails from Bodø to Moskenes. The ferry takes 3-4 hours and costs 30 EUR per passenger plus about 90 EUR for the car. There is also two other ferries that sails from Bodø to Svolvær (3.5 hours). Bodø is reached by low cost flights, but it also the northernmost stop on the Norwegian train network, therefore it's possible to take the train from Oslo or Bergen to Bodø.
5. **Fly to Tromso (If you have time)**

   A flight to Tromsø it means a complicated commute to Lofoten, and takes about 6-7 hours by bus with different change or renting a car, but it is still an option if you have time and want to exlpore a different amazing part of north Norway
