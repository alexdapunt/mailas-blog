If you only have one day in Oslo, maybe for a stopover (like me) this 24-hour city guide will show you the best of this Scandinavian city and how to get the most of it.

The city is generally very compact and a day is enough time to get an idea you will not see everything but 1 day it will allow you to see some of what makes it so special.

**Best Time to Visit Oslo**

While Oslo is great to see year round, we found it best to travel to Oslo during the summer months when you can really enjoy the outdoors.

Oslo City Hall

City Hall is one of Oslo’s main government buildings and is also a great example of their beautiful architecture. Don’t just admire this building from a far.

While it is a government building, it is open to the general public. Take a walk inside & you will find the interior walls lined with frescoes created by Henrik Sørensen, Edvard Munch and other famous Norwegian artists.

## **What is the Oslo Pass?**

The Oslo Pass entitles you to free entry to many museums and attractions in the city, as well as discounts on purchases at restaurants and stores and free public transport. To get started, simply download the Oslo Pass app on your phone for all the information you need on using the Oslo Pass and where you can activate your online purchase!

* **Cost:** The cost for 1 adult is 445 NOK (Approx. 40 EUR) for 24 hours, 655 NOK (Approx. 59 EUR) for 48 hours or 820 NOK (Approx. 74 EUR) for 72 hours. There are also discounts for children and seniors, see table below.

**The Sunday Market River Walk**

The Aker River flows through the centre of Oslo and the river walk is a popular (and free) Sunday outing. The river starts at Maridalsvatnet (the Maridal Lake) and runs straight into the Oslo Fjord. Pathways and roads along the way will allow you a glimpse into Oslo’s industrial past, while the Aamodt Bridge offers beautiful views over the waterfall to the Oslo University of the Arts campus. You can pick up the walk at any point along the river, but make sure you visit the markets in Grünerløkka, the hippest area of Oslo, where close to the popular Blå and Ingensteds restaurants, you’ll find local markets filled with knitwear, jewellery, glass, ceramic, antiques – in fact, everything a market lover could possibly want! _(Photo:Travelettes.net_
