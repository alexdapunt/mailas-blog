If you only have one day in Oslo, perhaps for a stopover (like me), this 24-hour city guide will show you the best of this Scandinavian city and how you can make the most of it.

The city is generally very compact and one day is enough to get a feel for it. you won't see everything, but one day will allow you to see some of the aspects that make it so special.

### Best Time to Visit Oslo

Although Oslo is beautiful to see all year round, it is definitely best to travel during the summer months when you can really enjoy the outdoors.

### What is the Oslo Pass?

The[ Oslo Pass](https://book.visitoslo.com/en/oslopass) entitles you to free entry to many museums and attractions in the city, as well as discounts on purchases in restaurants and shops and completely free public transport. 

Simply download the **Oslo Pass app** to get all the necessary information and how to activate it.

The **cost** for 1 adult is 445 NOK (Approx. 40 EUR) for 24 hours, 655 NOK (Approx. 59 EUR) for 48 hours or 820 NOK (Approx. 74 EUR) for 72 hours. 

It is an great option if you are interested in more than one museum attraction or if you prefer to travel by transport (which works perfectly well in the city) 

Keep in mind that Oslo is a rather small city and you can get around easily on foot or by bicycle.

### Oslo Itinerary: what you cannot skip

#### Oslo opera house 

Even if you don't visit a performance at the opera, it is definitely worth checking out the opera and walking on the roof, perhaps for the sunset.

#### Oslo City Hall

The City Hall is one of Oslo's main government buildings. Although it is a government building, it is open to the public. Take a walk inside and you will find the interior walls covered with frescoes created by Henrik Sørensen, Edvard Munch and other famous Norwegian artists.

#### Grunerlooka area

This once roughly working-class neighbourhood, but also a haven for artists (Edvard Munch grew up here), is now a great place to explore galleries, restaurants, cafés and vintage shops.

Don't miss Syverkiosken, not far from the area, one of Oslo's last hotdog stands. Here you can find sausages prepared in the traditional way,

The Aker river walk is a very popular (and free) Sunday outing.You can take the walk anywhere along the river, but be sure to visit the Sunday markets in Grünerløkka.

#### Munch Museum and the National Museum 

The new Munch Museum is a great place to discover Munch's art, and you can also visit the sky bar for a view of Oslo and the Opera House. 

The National Museum in Oslo, on the other hand, houses one of the most important Norwegian collections in the world and also some of Edvard Munch's paintings, including the iconic 'The Scream' (the earliest known version can be found here and the rest in the Munch Museum).
