Melbourne is known as the culturale capital of Australia

There are so many things to do in the city, but to visit the main attractions a day or two is enough.

I have listed the top best things, that I have done in the city and some tips.

You can easily walk around the city or take the train and tram, there is even a free tram zone to travel on all trams in Melbourne's Central Business District and Docklands.

You will have to buy a card (myki) that stores two types of value on the one card - myki pass (travel days) and/or myki money (a dollar amount).

Melbourne does not have some of the big tourist attractions of other capital cities, so the best way to see it is definitely to wander around and find the interesting things

#### Stop in one of the many coffe bars

Melbourne is famous for its coffee. Almost everywhere you are assured of good coffee (guaranteed by an Italian).

If you want to have a great breakfast and great coffee, go to Axil Coffee Roasters: although quite crowded, it is worth a visit.

Don't forget to order a flat white, which apparently originated in Australia in the 1980s.

#### Visit Flinders Street Station and Federation Square

Federation Square is a great landmark for visitors and one of Melbourne's points of interest, where you could start your tour of the city center. Nearby is the city's main train station, Flinders Street Station

#### State Library Victoria

This one of Melbourne's most beautiful buildings and the State Library.

The Trobe Reading Room is surely the most famous room, which can be admired from the balconies of the top floors accessible by an elevator 

If you would like to learn more about the library, free guided tours are offered during the week.

#### Shrine of Remembrance

It is a memorial intended to remember the sacrifices made by those who lost their lives during World War I.

The shrine was erected in Kings Domain Gardens shortly after the end of the war.

You can also catch a beautiful view of the city
