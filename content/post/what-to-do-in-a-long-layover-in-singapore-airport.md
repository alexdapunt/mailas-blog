If there is one place where it is no problem to have a transit or long layover, it is Singapore's Changi Airport!

Whether you want to visit the city or enjoy different options within the airport, it is definitely the best airport for a stopover in Southeast Asia.

### Things to do

##### **See the HSBC Rain Vortex**

This is the world's tallest indoor waterfall, located inside the Singapore airport in the mall in front of arrivals (you will have to go through immigration and have an entry visa)

##### Take a dip in the rooftop pool and hot tub

Located at the Singapore Airport transit hotel in Terminal 1, you pay an entrance fee of about 18 Singapore dollars and can stay as long as you want to enjoy some sun and refresh yourself before your flight.

##### **Watch a Movie in the Cinema**

You can find the movie [theatres](https://www.changiairport.com/en/airport-guide/facilities-and-services/movie-theatre.html?spm=BlogArticle.InArticleHyperlinkWord&clickId=ac83758b1d) in terminal 2 and 3 where you can watch  the different films free of charge

##### **Look at the Art Exhibits**

There are countless art installations & exhibits at the airport

##### **Go in the city center**

It is very easy and quick to exit the airport and reach downtown. The city of Singapore is quite small.  
It is recommended to visit the city if you have at least 6 hours.

You can leave your luggage right after immigration control for about 10 SGD for a carry-on. It is the best to leave your luggage and all other heavy backpacks behind, as they will be a hassle to carry when you explore the city.

**How to get there**

You can get to the city center by cab or by MRT train service.  
The MRT costs about 2 SGD and a cab about 20 SGD.  
The train involves a change and takes about an hour, with the cab you are in the city center in about 15-20 minutes.  
If you are not traveling on a tight budget I recommend taking a cab, because you do not want to waste too many hours in the MRT , having limited time to visit the city

**Must seen**

1. **Gardens by the bay**

You can start your itinerary from Gardens by the Bay. The garden itself is free, but if you want to see some of the attractions inside you will have to pay different kinds of fees.

The Supertree Grove is the main attraction, with its large, colorful trees; they also hold some very nice shows in the evenings (check the website for times)

You can climb to the top of the trees or you can walk the Skyway that connects some of the trees.

2. **Marina Bay Sands**

In the same area as garden by the bay, you can walk around Marina Bay Sands.

You can go up above the observatory for 23 SGD, the view is worth it but it is definitely expensive

To find the entrance just head to Tower 3.

The Merlion is perhaps the symbol of Singapore. It is a large fountain with the head of a lion and the tail of a fish. From here you have a nice view of Marina Bay Sands and the ArtScience Museum across the water.

When you visit the Merlion also take a walk around Clarke Quay, it is a very nice area and there are many places to eat.

4. **Little India**

Visit this super colourful and chaotic neighbourhood. There are three beautiful temples: Sri Veeramakaliamman, Sri Srinivasa Perumal and the Temple of a Thousand Lights.

The most iconic place in Little India on instagram is the colourful Tan Teng Niah house, which is actually a relic of the Chinese colonisation of Singapore

5. **Chinatown**

Singapore's Chinatown is the most iconic neighbourhood with a wealth of historic buildings and restaurants. It is home to the world's cheapest famous starred restaurant, Liao Fan Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle.

It is quite close to Little India and is a very interesting area of Singapore to explore.

6. **ArtScience Museum**

If you have a little more time the _Future World exhibit_ is definitely worth a visit. Everything is interactive and there are several stations where you can play games.
