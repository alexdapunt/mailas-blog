If there is one place where it is not a problem to have transit or a long layover, it would be Singapore! 

Whether you want to tour the city or enjoy different options inside the airport, It’s the for sure the best airport for a layover in Southeast Asia. 

Visit

**See the World’s Tallest Indoor Waterfall:** The Rain Vortex is a waterfall located inside the Singapore Airport. It is a massive display; measuring 7 stories tall.

* **Look at the Art Exhibits:** There are countless art installations & exhibits at the airport. Some favorites are [_The Memory of Lived Space_](http://www.janetlaurence.com/the-memory-of-lived-spaces/) & [_Singapore Rojak_](https://yipyc.com/blog/2018/07/19/singapore-rojak-batik/).
* **Take a dip in the pool & jacuzzi:** Pay a day rate to spend time in a rooftop pool & jacuzzi.
* **Get a Spa Service:** Indulge in a spa treatment at the airport spa.

**Watch a Movie in the Theatre:** Go see a new movie at the Singapore Airport Movie Theatre.

**Go in the city center** 

it’s quick and easy to get out of the airport and into the center.

Advisable to follow if you have at least 6 hours of total Singapore layover time.

you _need_ to have a valid visa to exit the Singapore Changi Airport and clear immigration

_You can leave your heavy carry on after immigration_

Prices vary depending on suitcase size, I paid 10 Singaporean Dollars (SGD) for the whole day for my carry-on trolley.

_Don’t forget to leave your luggage at the airport. It’s best to leave your carry-on too, as well as any other heavy backpacks because they will be a pain to carry when you explore the city._

The two easiest ways to get from Singapore Changi Airport to the city centre of Singapore are either by taxi or with the MRT train service.

The MRT costs around 2 SGD versus the 20 SGD of a [taxi](https://www.getyourguide.com/singapore-l170/singapore-changi-airport-tofrom-hotel-private-transfer-t367915/?partner_id=YK95C97&utm_medium=online_publisher&utm_source=greta%27s_travels&placement=content-top&cmp=SingaporeLayover), however it can take up to an hour whilst the taxi will get you there in 15 minutes.

Even if you have a long layover in Singapore, I would personally recommend getting a taxi as you don’t want to waste 2 hours out of your 12 hours in Singapore in the MRT just trying to get into the city centre and back.

Gardens by the bay

Hail a public taxi from Changi Airport and instruct them to take you to _Gardens by the Bay_. It will take you a maximum of 15 minutes to locate a taxi and 30 minutes to drive from the airport to Gardens by the Bay. In total, the entire process should take you around 45 minutes.

Access to the gardens is free and you can walk around almost everywhere, but you do have to pay for some of the attractions inside.

The Supertree Grove, as the name implies, is the main attraction with the big colourful trees.

You can get on top of the trees entering OCBC Skyway for 8 SGDthere is a walkway path that connects some of the trees.

Marina Bay Sands

Walk around _Marina Bay Sands,_ which is located next to Gardens by the Bay. There are a lot of things to see within Marina Bay Sands, and the recommended amount of time to spend there is 2 to 4 hours. Because you’ll be on a time crunch, settle for only being able to see a glimpse of it and spend 1.5 hours there.

The price to access the observation deck is 23 SGD, which is a bit expensive considering it’s just for the view.

I struggled a little to find how to get to the top since my taxi had dropped me off on the other side of the hotel, it’s easier to find if you head straight for Tower 3.

The merlion 

The Merlion is one of the most popular tourist sites in Singapore. It is a large fountain with the head of a lion and the tail of fish, representing Singapore’s beginnings as a fishing village and it’s original name “Singapura” meaning “lion city”.

If your layover is during the day I still recommend going for a walk along Clarke Quay, it’s a very pretty area and there are lots of cool places to eat.

Plus day drinking isn’t frowned upon when you’re flying so I’d say you’re allowed a cheeky pint even in the middle of the day.

From Clarke Quay you walk along the Esplanade Bridge until you reach the famous Merlion statue, from here there’s a pretty good view of Marina Bay Sands and the ArtScience Museum from across the bay.

  
**Little India**

According to my fiance, Singapore’s Little India has the best south Indian food outside of India. I did not have the opportunity to visit Little India, but I hope to visit during my next trip to Singapore.

In a brief period of time you can visit three beautiful temples; Sri Veeramakaliamman (good luck asking for directions!), Sri Srinivasa Perumal and the Temple of a Thousand Lights.

An iconic Little India spot is the colourful house of Tan Teng Niah, which as you may imagine from the name is actually a relic of the Chinese colonisation of Singapore but you have to thank the Indian community for its bright colours and building upkeep.

**Chinatown**

Singapore’s Chinatown is an energetic neighborhood with a ton of beautiful buildings, historic sites, and restaurants. One of the cheapest Michelin starred restaurants in the world is located here- Liao Fan Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle (Hawker Chan).

It’s fairly close to Little India and is a very interesting area of Singapore to explore.

ArtScience Museum

The Future World exhibition definitely deserves a visit. Everything is interactive and there are stations all throughout where you can play educational games.
