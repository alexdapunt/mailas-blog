# How To Visit Machu Picchu, Peru

**A Complete Backpacking Travel Guide**

  
Machu Picchu is one of the most well-known tourist attractions in the world, thanks to the status the ruin received in 2007, becoming one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. With that new fame comes with a massive outpour of tourists from all corners of the world, wanting to see Machu Picchu in person. You would think that there is no way to avoid the crowds in Machu Picchu but I'm here to prove that wrong as I was able to experience Machu Picchu, free of people, without even hiking and all in one day. Here's how to avoid the crowds in Machu Picchu.

### How To Avoid Crowds In Machu Picchu

  
One of the most convenient and affordable ways to visit Machu Picchu is to organize a transfer service via a travel agency in Cusco. It will be cheaper than booking one online and you can browse through all the offers by different agencies and pick the best one for you. You have to be in Cusco for at least 5 days in order to do this since the tickets are often fully booked for the next 2 days or so.

Once you pay, the travel agency will prepare all the tickets for you in an envelope that they will give you the next day.
