# How to see all the main spots in 2 weeks

**A Complete Backpacking Travel Guide if you have a fixed timeline** 

If you are short on time and don't want to miss any of the main attractions, follow this guide.

P.S not suitable for those who like to travel in comfort

### Day 1 Lima

Arrive in Lima, honestly there is not much to see in the city. One day is more than enough time to get a feel for the city and start tasting the delicious Peruvian food. Some of the best restaurants in South America are right here!

NOTE stay and get lost in miraflores or barranco area

### Day 2-3 Huachacina

Take a bus from Lima to Ica and then a taxi or a Tuk Tuk  to get to the huachachina desert oasis, it will take 10 min.

I recommend sleeping in Huachachina, there are different hotels, we choose to stay in the camping

NOTE You can add a stop and a day in Paracas before going to Huachachina, the bus stop there and explore the Islas Ballestas

### Day 4 Nazca lines

Stop in Nazca to explore the famous and mysterious lines. One morning is more than enough in the city

From Nazca catch a night bus for Arequipa

### Day 5-6 Arequipa

You will arrive in Arequipa in the morning take these two days to acclimatise to the increasing altitude

NOTE Colca Canyon is not super far, this is a scenic canyon known for its condors is a popular destination for hiking tours & bird-watching.

### Day 7 Puno

Take a bus for Puno, it is your entry spot for the Titicaca lake, the world's highest altitude navigable lake

### Day 7-8 Titicaca lake

Explore the island, sleep with the locals

On the second day take a night bus from Puno to Cusco it will take around 7 h and save you some times traveling during night

### Day 9 Cusco

The city is really touristic but take the time to get use the altiudine and get ready to the inca trail

### Day 10-11 The inca trail to Machu Pitch

It also known as _Camino Inca._ I highly recommend to do this famous hiking that terminates at Machu Picchu.Trekkers normally take four or five days to complete the "Classic Inca Trail" but a two-day trek from Km 104 is also possible.

It is an unbelievable and stunning combination of the region's ruins, mountainscapes, and cloud jungles.

NOTE if you don't feel sporty enough you can take a train from Cusco that will bring you directly to Ollatatainbo to visit only Machu Picchu

### Day 12 Rainbow Mountain

Also it it will take some times to arrive (around 2 h) you can organise a day trip to the rainbow mountain from Cusco. There is no need to book it in advance online there are plenty of travel agency on site you can choose from

### Day 13 Iquitos

Iquitos it is only reachable by plan. It is gateway to the jungle lodges and tribal villages of the northern Amazon. From Cusco you will need to do a stop in Lima before.

Internal flight are really cheap, we paid around 50EUR roundtrip from Cusco to Iquitos with LATAM airlines.  You can also choose Star Peru.

### Day 14-15-16 Amazon forest

Book a lounge in one of the many tribal villages in the forest and enjoy life in the jungle

### Day 17 Lima

Go back to Lima to catch the return flight and maybe try their amazing nikkei food.

**Nikkei** is a delicious combination of both Japanese and Peruvian ingredients â€“ a cooking style which dates back to the turn of the century -and has influenced chefs everywhere.

### Other Recommendations

* My saved google place
* I can only recommend Miguel and his team if you are planning the inca trail trek or any excursion: [https://www.cuscojourneys.com/](https://www.cuscojourneys.com/ "https://www.cuscojourneys.com/")
* Booking
* Try to go slow with the altitudine and avoid fly directly to Cuzsco from Lima, you will feel it
* You can buy bus tickets directly at the different bus station, the most recommended companies for tourists are cruzdelsur and Civa I travel with different unknown companies and never felt unsafe but you can see an higher quality and cleaness in the CruzDelSur buses
* Drink as many Pisco Sour as you can
* If you only wanna go tu Machuu Pichuu and avoid the trekking buy the tickets in advance at the official website, pay attention to buy the right path, the famous spot for the photo from above is on the path 3
* To travel lighter you can keep your hotel room or ask in the hotel in Cusco while going to the inca trail or Machu Picchu to keep your luggage
