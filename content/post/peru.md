# How to see all the main spots in 2 weeks

**A Complete Backpacking Travel Guide if you have a fixed timeline**

If you are short on time and don't want to miss any of the main attractions, follow this guide.

P.S not suitable for those who like to travel in comfort

### Day 1 Lima

Arrive in Lima, honestly there is not much to see in the city. One day is more than enough time to get a feel for the city and start tasting the delicious Peruvian food. Some of the best restaurants in South America are right here!

**Note**

Find an accommodation in Miraflores or Barranco area

### Day 2-3 Huachacina

Take a bus from Lima to Ica and then a taxi or a Tuk Tuk to arrive in around 10 minutes to Huachachina desert oasis

I recommend sleeping in Huachachina, there are different hotels, we choose to stay in the camping

**Note**

You can add a stop and day in Paracas before going to Huachachina and exploring the Ballestas Islands, the bus from Lima stops there

### Day 4 Nazca lines

Stop in Nazca to explore the famous and mysterious lines, a group of geoglyphs, large line drawings that from a distance appear to be engraved on the earth's surface.

From Nazca catch a night bus for Arequipa to save some times

**Note**

Colca Canyon is not super far, this is a scenic canyon known for its condors is a popular destination for hiking tours & bird-watching.

### Day 7 Puno

Take a bus for Puno, it is your entry spot for the Titicaca lake, the world's highest altitude navigable lake

### Day 7-8 Titicaca lake

Explore the island and sleep with the locals

On the second day take a night bus from Puno to Cusco it will take around 7 h and save you some times traveling during night

### Day 9 Cusco

The city is really touristic but take the time to get use the altiudine and get ready to the inca trail.

Former capital city of the Incas, Cusco is the starting point for all the excursions

### Day 10-11 The inca trail to Machu Pitch

It also known as _Camino Inca._ I highly recommend to do this famous hiking that terminates at Machu Picchu.Trekkers normally take four or five days to complete the "Classic Inca Trail" but a two-day trek from Km 104 is also possible.

It is an incredible and amazing combination of incas ruins, mountain landscapes and jungles in the region.

**Notes**

* You cannot hike the Inca Trail without a professional guide and all the necessary permits, there are several gates where it is checked (don't forget your passport)
* If you do not feel sporty enough, you can take a train from Cusco that will take you directly to Ollatatainbo to visit only Machu Picchu. 
* If you have time you can also add the Maras Salt Mines or the Humantay Lake

### Day 12 Rainbow Mountain

It will take some time to get there (about 2 hours), but it is possible to organise a day trip to Rainbow Mountain from Cusco and it is definitely worth it. There is no need to book in advance online, there are many local travel agencies to choose from.

**Note**

Be careful because you touch more than 5000 metres above sea level and the walk is very strenuous

### Day 13 Iquitos

Iquitos can only be reached by plane. It is the gateway to the jungle lodges and tribal villages of the northern Amazon. From Cusco it is necessary to make a stop in Lima first.

Internal flights are very cheap, we paid around 50EUR round trip from Cusco to Iquitos with the airline LATAM.  You can also choose Star Peru.

### Day 14-15-16 Peruvian Amazon forest

Book a lounge in one of the many tribal villages in the forest and enjoy life in the jungle

**Note**

Drop me a message if you are interested to get in touch with a Shaman

### Day 17 Lima

Go back to Lima to catch the return flight and maybe take some time to explore the area you missed in the first day

Note 

Try the Nikkei food is a delicious combination of both Japanese and Peruvian ingredients â€“ a cooking style which dates back to the turn of the century -and has influenced chefs everywhere.

### Other Recommendations

* You can follow my Goole maps with places to see and restaurants saved
* If you are planning to do the inca trail trek I can only recommend Miguel and his team: [https://www.cuscojourneys.com/](https://www.cuscojourneys.com/ "https://www.cuscojourneys.com/")
* Booking affiliate link
* Try to go easy on the altitude and avoid flying directly to Cuzsco from Lima, you will feel it.
* You can buy bus tickets directly at the different bus stations, the most recommended companies for tourists are cruzdelsur and Civa I travelled with several unknown companies and never felt unsafe, but you can notice a higher quality in CruzDelSur buses
* Drink as many Pisco Sour as you can
* If you only want to go to Machuu Pichuu and avoid the trek, buy your tickets in advance on the official website, making sure to buy the right path, the famous photo point from the top is on path 3.
* To travel lighter, you can keep booked your hotel room or ask the hotel in Cusco to keep your luggage when on your way to the Inca Trail or Machu Picchu
