A volunteering trip abroad can be the experience of a lifetime. The benefits of volunteering abroad are many. Unfortunately, the cost can discourage some from going.

Many associations, in fact, charge a fee to cover the cost of the experience.

This is a guide on how I managed to go without spending anything beyond beyond accommodation and meals.

## Can I Volunteer Abroad for Free?

That is how I went to work for free for a month in an orphanage in Kenya.

### 1. Choose the destination and the cause you want to embrace

I decided to go and work for an orphanage, but it could be things like cleaning the seabed, rescuing animals or empowering women

### 2. Research on Google and make a list

Just Google the place you are looking for where you want to go, for example I searched for _Orphange in Kenya_. The results are quite extensive

### 3. Prepare an email and contact many of them

Prepare an e-mail introducing yourself and ask if they are looking for a volunteer and your reason for contacting them

### 3. Choose the one

The response rate was very high and it was really difficult to choose just one.

Usually they only ask you to pay a small amount for meals and accommodation, I paid around 300 euros for the whole month

### 4. Depending on the country ask for a sponsor letter

I need a sponsorship letter for the VISA in Kenya

### 5. Secure the tickets

And arrange with them the arriving

### 6. Go and enjoy the experience

It will change your life
