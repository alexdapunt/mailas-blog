A volunteering trip abroad can be the experience of a lifetime. The benefits of volunteering abroad are many. Unfortunately, the cost may discourage some from going.

Many associations in fact ask for a fee to cover the cost of the experience.

This is the guide on how we managed to go without spending anything more than accommodation and food

## Can I Volunteer Abroad for Free?

This is how I went working 1 month in an orphanage in Kenya for free.

### 1. Choose the destination and the cause you want to embrace

I decided to go working for an orphanage, but can be cleaning the seabed, rescuing animals or woman's empowerment 

### 2. Research on Google and make a list 

Simply google the place you are looking in the place you are aiming to go, for example I googled _Orphange in Kenya._ The results are pretty broad 

### 3. Prepare an email and contact many of them 

Prepare an email presenting yourself and ask if they are looking for a volunteer and the reason you are contacting them 

### 3. Choose the one 

My response rate was really high and it was really difficult to choose only one. 

Usually they just ask you to pay a small amount for accommodation and food, I paid around 300EUR for the entire month

### 4. Depending on the country ask for a sponsor letter 

I need a sponsorship letter for the VISA in Kenya and arranged with them the arriving 

### 5. Secure the tickets  

### 6. Leave and enjoy the experience 

It will change your life
